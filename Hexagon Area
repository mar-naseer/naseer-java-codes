Write a Java program to compute hexagon area.

Test Data:
Input the length of a side of the hexagon: 6

Sample Output:

Input the length of a side of the hexagon: 6                                                                  
The area of the hexagon is: 93.53074360871938

Java Code:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Exercise34 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Prompt the user to input the length of a side of the hexagon
        System.out.print("Input the length of a side of the hexagon: ");
        
        // Read the length of a side from the user
        double s = input.nextDouble();
        
        // Calculate and display the area of the hexagon
        System.out.print("The area of the hexagon is: " + hexagonArea(s) + "\n");
    }

    public static double hexagonArea(double s) {
        // Calculate the area of a hexagon based on its side length
        return (6 * (s * s)) / (4 * Math.tan(Math.PI / 6));
    }
}

Explanation:

In the exercise above -

First it uses the "Scanner" class to obtain input from the user.
It prompts the user to input the length of a side of the hexagon using System.out.print("Input the length of a side of the hexagon: ") and reads the input into the variable 's'.
It then calls a separate method named "hexagonArea()" and passes the input length s as an argument.
Inside the "hexagonArea()" method:
It calculates the area of the hexagon using the formula (6 s^2) / (4 tan(π/6)), where s is the length of a side and tan(π/6) represents the tangent of 30 degrees (π/6 radians), which is a constant value.
It returns the calculated area as a double.
Finally, back in the "main()" method, it prints the result of the "hexagonArea()" method, displaying the area of the hexagon based on the user-provided side length.
