Convert Inches to Meters:

Write a Java program that reads a number in inches and converts it to meters.

The inch is a unit of length in the (British) imperial and United States customary systems of measurement now formally equal to ​1/36 yard but usually understood as ​1/12 of a foot.

The meter is the base unit of length in some metric systems, including the International System of Units (SI). The SI unit symbol is m.

Note: One inch is 0.0254 meter.

Test Data
Input a value for inch: 1000
_____________________________________________________________________________

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Exercise2 {

    public static void main(String[] Strings) {

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Input a value for inch: ");
        double inch = input.nextDouble();
        double meters = inch * 0.0254;
        System.out.println(inch + " inch is " + meters + " meters");

    }
}

Sample Output:

Input a value for inch: 1000                                                                                  
1000.0 inch is 25.4 meters
